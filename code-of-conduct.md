Contributors to the Rust project hold themselves to a specific code of conduct. As members of the Rust community, we seek to emulate this code. Here are the pertinent bits, adapted to our purposes:

1. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.
2. Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
3. Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
4. Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice, in any programming language, carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
5. Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. Brainstorming is welcome, but concrete language proposals and bikeshedding would probably be better served on the Rust discussion forums.
6. We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean, or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the Citizen Code of Conduct; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition.
7. Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact any of the Rust subreddit moderators immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
8. Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.

Our policies for upholding these standards of conduct are likewise adapted from the Rust project's standards of moderation, and are as follows:

1. Remarks that violate the Rust standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)
2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be temporarily banned for one day in order to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned indefinitely.
6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology. [kibwen's note: this has actually happened, multiple times!]
7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in private. Complaining about bans on the subreddit itself is not allowed.
8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

In the Rust community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better â€“ remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow Rustaceans comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.
